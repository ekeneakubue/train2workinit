                                        I was working a dead-end job before I took Train2WorkinIT Academy's Cyber Security 
                                        training course. I had always been interested in technology, but I didn't know where 
                                        to start. The course gave me the skills and knowledge I needed to land a job as a Cyber 
                                        Security Analyst. I'm now making more money than I ever thought possible, and I'm doing
                                        work that I love. I'm so grateful to Train2WorkinIT Academy for helping me start my

                                        referred me to Train2WorkinIT Academy. I enrolled in Train2WorkinIT Academy's online 
                                        IT training course, which allowed me to accommodate my family's schedule. Learning new 
                                        skills at my own pace, I received excellent support from my instructor whenever I 
                                        needed it. Upon completing the course, I secured a position as an SOC Analyst. 
                                        I now work from home, supporting my family while doing something I love.

                                        I was a recent college graduate when I took Train2WorkinIT Academy's IT training course. 
                                        I had a degree in computer science, but I didn't have any real-world experience. The course 
                                        gave me the hands-on training that I needed to be successful in the job market. I was able 
                                        learn about the latest technologies and trends, and I was able to practice my skills in a 
                                        real-world environment. After I finished the course, I was able to land a job as a Cyber 
                                        Security Analyst at a large company. I'm now able to use my skills to help keep the company's
